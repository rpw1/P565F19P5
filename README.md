I assume everyone here is familiar with GitHub, but I will have a simple tutorial just in case.

* Download git if you haven't yet
* I would recommend Github Desktop if you don't want to work on command line
* Get the repo on your machine using

```
$ git clone <Repository HTTPS>
```

* Next add a file or make a change in the README.md
* Add a file using:
```
$ git add --all
```
* Then you need to commit changes
```
$ git commit -am "<Commit comments>"
```
* Finally, push your changes and add the origin to your upstream
```
$ git push -u origin
```
